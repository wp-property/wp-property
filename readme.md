We have setup a ["Shortcode Cheatsheet" page](https://www.usabilitydynamics.com/tutorials/wp-property-help/wp-property-shortcode-cheat-sheet/) for your convenience.

* [property_overview]
* [property_search]
* [property_map]
* [property_attribute]
* [featured_properties]
* [list_attachments]

##### [property_overview]
Property Overview Shortcode. It is used to display a list of properties.  In it's most basic form, it will return all the published properties on your site.
* [property_overview pagination=on] Show all properties and enable pagination.
* [property_overview sorter=on] Will list all properties with sorting.
* [property_overview per_page=5] Show 5 properties on a page (10 properties is the default). If you use this shortcode - you don't need to use 'pagination=on'.
* [property_overview for_sale=true] or [property_overview type=building]
* [property_overview bathrooms=1,3 bedrooms=2-4] Use "," for setting specific values of attributes and "-" for ranges.
* [property_overview sorter=on sort_by=price sort_order=DESC pagination=on] Will list all properties sorted by price in DESC order (attribute "Price" should be checked as sorted in Properties->Settings->Developer page ) and paginate.

Usage of custom attributes added in the Developer tab for queries, example:<br>
* [property_overview house_color=blue,green] List all blue and green properties.
* [property_overview type=single_family_home year_built=1995-2010] List all single family homes built between 1995 and 2010.
* [property_overview type=apartment pets_allowed=yes] All apartments where "Pets Allowed" attribute is set to "yes".
* [property_overview template=detailed-overview] will load property-overview-detailed-overview.php from your theme folder.

##### [property_search]
Property Search. This shortcode renders a search form, much like the Property Search widget. In it's most basic form it will display the first 5 attributes that you have selected as being searchable in the Developer tab.
* [property_search searchable_attributes=bedrooms,bathrooms searchable_property_types=single_family_home per_page=10] A more complex example showing search options for bedrooms and bathrooms, return only Single Family Homes and limiting the search results to 10 per page.
* [property_search do_not_use_cache=true searchable_attributes=bedrooms,bathrooms] By default the search widget, and the search shortcode, cache the values used in dropdowns.  You can force the shortcode to avoid getting the values from cache and force it to generate the values on-the-fly when the page is opened.  This is generally not recommended because it slows down the page load-time, but may be useful when troubleshooting.
If you want to use address attributes in [property_search] you will have to add them using the Developer tab.  Watch screencast on adding address attributes to property_search shortcode.

##### [property_map]
Single Property Map. This shortcode displays property maps from single property pages.

##### [property_attribute]
Property Attribute. Property Attribute Shortcodes return the value of an attribute for a specific property. The current property is targeted by default. Properties other than the current one can be specified using their property ID number, as shown below.
* [property_attribute attribute=bedrooms] Get the number of bedrooms for current property.
* [property_attribute property_id=5 attribute=bathrooms] Get the number of bathrooms for a property with an ID of 5.
* [property_attribute attribute=status] Shows status for current property.
* [property_attribute attribute=map] Shows map for current property

##### [property_attributes]
Property Attributes. Renders List of Property Attributes.
* [property_attributes include=bedrooms,price] Renders only specified attributes: Bedrooms and Price
* [property_attributes exclude=bedrooms,price] Renders all attributes except of Bedrooms and Price

##### [property_meta]
Property Meta. Renders List of Property Meta fields.
* [property_meta] Renders all meta fields for current property.
* [property_meta include=school] Renders only specified meta: School

##### [property_terms]

* [featured_properties type='all' stats='price'] Shows all featured properties, and display their prices.

##### [list_attachments]
List Attachments Shortcode is used to display attachments of a property, can also be used in a post. Ported over from List Attachments Shortcode plugin.  If plugin exists, the WP-Property version of shortcode is not loaded.

#### Add-ons and Themes
