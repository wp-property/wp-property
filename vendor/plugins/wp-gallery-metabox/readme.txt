== Description ==

NOTE: This uses the old media gallery interface, and I have no plans to change this. 

I use the WordPress Gallery a lot on websites I build. It's a wonderful tool, but it's hard to find. Instead of telling users "Click the first icon next to Upload/Insert, then click the gallery tab", I created this simple plugin to display all the attached images in a metabox. 

It's also customizable for developers (see documentation).
