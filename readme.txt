= Common Shortcodes =

We have setup a  ["Shortcode Cheatsheet" page](http://usabilitydynamics.com/help/wp-property-help/wp-property-shortcode-cheat-sheet/) for your convenience.

Include search form into page/post content.

* [property_search] Include search widget on content of a page or a post.
* [property_search searchable_attributes=bedrooms,bathrooms searchable_property_types=single_family_home per_page=10] Show search options for bedrooms and bathrooms; return only Single Family Homes, and show 10 results per page.

Shortcodes are used to display listings. Simply put a shortcode into the body of a post or page, and a list of properties will be displayed in its place on the front-end of your website.

* [property_overview pagination=on] Show all properties and enable pagination.
* [property_overview sorter=on] Will list all properties with sorting.
* [property_overview per_page=5] Show 5 properties on a page (10 properties is the default). If you use this shortcode - you don't need to use 'pagination=on'.
* [property_overview for_sale=true] or [property_overview type=building]
* [property_overview bathrooms=1,3 bedrooms=2-4] Use "," for setting specific values of attributes and "-" for ranges.
* [property_overview sorter=on sort_by=price sort_order=DESC pagination=on] Will list all properties sorted by price in DESC order (attribute "Price" should be checked as sorted in Properties->Settings->Developer page ) and paginate.

Usage of custom attributes added in the Developer tab for queries, example:

* [property_overview house_color=blue,green] List all blue and green properties.
* [property_overview type=single_family_home year_built=1995-2010] List all single family homes built between 1995 and 2010.
* [property_overview type=apartment pets_allowed=yes] All apartments where "Pets Allowed" attribute is set to "yes".
* [property_overview template=detailed-overview] will load property-overview-detailed-overview.php from your theme folder.

= New features =

* New shortcode: [property_attribute] to pull a single attribute without using PHP. Example: [property_attribute attribute=bedrooms] will return the number of bedrooms for current property. [property_attribute property_id=4 attribute=bathrooms] will return the number of bathrooms for property with ID of 5.
* New shortcode: [property_map] to pull a single attribute without using PHP. Example: [property_map width="100%" height="100px" zoom_level=11 property_id=5].  Leave property_id blank to get map for currently displayed property.
* Two different sorter styles available, buttons and dropdown.
* "Sort by:" text can be customized in [property_overview] shortcode using the sort_by_text argument.

== Installation ==

2. Visit Properties -> Settings page and set "Property Page" to one of your pages. This will be used in the URL to show all your single property listings.  For example, if you have a page called "Apartments", and you select it, your property URLs will be built like this: http://yoursite.com/apartments/property-name-here
3. Check "Automatically insert property overview into property page content." or copy and paste [property_overview] into the body of your main property page.
4. Visit Appearance -> Widgets and set up the widgets you want to show on your different property type pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I can't see the developer tab? =

The developer tab should appear within a few seconds after you install the plugin.  If it doesn't, go to Properties -> Settings -> Troubleshooting and click the "Check Updates" button.

= My theme is not working... HELP =

Because there are so many different themes available for WP, not all of them will work flawlessly out of the box.  You can either customize your own theme, contact us for a theme customization quote or purchase one of our premium themes such as the Denali.

= Is the plugin available in different languages? =

Due to contributions from the plugin users we currently have it in Italian, Russian and Portuguese translations. If you would like to translate the plugin in your own languages please email us the files when you are done so we can include them in future updates.

= Side Bar disappears =

This is a theme issue. Once again you can customize your own theme, email us and we can give you a quote or you can purchase the Denali.

= How do stylesheets work? =

The plugin uses your theme's stylesheet, but also has its own. Inside the plugin folder (wp-content/plugins/wp-property/templates) there is a file called "wp_properties.css". Copy that file to your template directory, and the plugin will automatically switch to using the settings in that file, and will not load the default one anymore. That way when you upgrade the plugin, your custom CSS will not be overwritten. Same goes for all the other template files.

= How do I upload property images? =

You would do it the same way as if you were editing a post or a page.  On the property editing page, click the Image icon above the content area, and upload images into the media library.  If you want the images to show up on the front-end, you may want to visit Appearance -> Widgets and setup the Property Gallery widget to show up on the property page.

= How do I suggest an idea? =

You can send us a message via our website, or, preferably, visit our [feedback.TwinCitiesTech.com](http://feedback.twincitiestech.com/forums/95259-wp-property) page to submit new, and vote on existing, ideas.

= I like where this is going, but how do I get customization? =

If you submit a popular idea on UserVoice, we WILL integrate it sooner or later.  If you need something custom, and urgent, [contact us](http://twincitiestech.com/contact-us/)
